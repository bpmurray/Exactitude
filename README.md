# Exactitude - Converter and Conversion comparisons
This project is used to convert files from one format to another, and to provide a measurement of the quality of the output. It uses the concept of [perceptual hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing "Wikipedia article") to create a human-like visual comparison of the original and source files.

Exactitude depends on a number of external software packages which are all automatically created by the build scripts:
* The perceptual hashing library [pHash](http://www.phash.org/)
* others?
